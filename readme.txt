Automating Spotify with Python

THE PLAN
All liked videos on Youtube should be automated generated on Spotify as a song.

1) How we do it now, manually?
a) You need to be logged in Spotify and Youtube
b) You need to check your Youtube likes
c) enter your Spotify account and create a playlist

2) Map steps with Python functions


WHICH TOOLS ARE GOING TO USE?
- Youtube Data API https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3
- Spotify Web API https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ 
- youtube_dli https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl #download videos from youtube.com or other video platforms
- py requests lib https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/ #http for humans!!!
